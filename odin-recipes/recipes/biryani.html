<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>

  In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste,
  red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well and
  let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Prepare the Rice: </strong>

  Wash the basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. In a
  large pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the washed rice, green
  cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt. Cook the rice until it's
  70-80% cooked (it should still have a slight bite to it). Drain the water and
  set the rice aside.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Cook the Chicken: </strong>
  In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the
  sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove some
  for garnish if desired. Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook until
  it's no longer pink and starts to brown. Add the chopped tomatoes, green
  chilies, and half of the chopped coriander and mint leaves. Cook until the
  tomatoes are soft and the chicken is cooked through. If you like, you can
  sprinkle some biryani masala at this stage for extra flavor.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Layering the Biryani: </strong>
  In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, layer half of the partially cooked rice at the
  bottom. Add the cooked chicken mixture on top of the rice. Sprinkle the
  remaining coriander and mint leaves over the chicken. Layer the remaining rice
  on top of the chicken.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Dum Cooking (Slow Cooking): </strong>
  Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil. Cook on
  low heat (dum) for 20-25 minutes. You can also place a heavy pan or tava
  (griddle) under the biryani pot to distribute heat evenly. Check for doneness
  by inserting a fork into the biryani. If it comes out clean, it's ready.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Garnish and Serve: </strong>
  Garnish the chicken biryani with fried onions and saffron milk (if using).
  Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) or a side salad.
